# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction is a data-driven analytical approach used by telecommunications companies to forecast whether their customers are likely to churn or remain with the service. Churn refers to the act of customers discontinuing their subscription or switching to a competitor, which can result in significant revenue loss for telecom providers. This predictive model leverages historical customer data, such as call records, usage patterns, billing information, and customer demographics, to identify early warning signs of potential churn.

By analyzing this data, telecom companies can develop predictive models that assign a churn probability score to each customer. These scores help prioritize customer retention efforts by focusing resources on those with the highest likelihood of churning. we used machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques such as, decision trees and Random Forest Classification are employed to create these models.

The benefits of telecom customer churn prediction are twofold. First, it enables proactive measures to be taken to retain at-risk customers, such as offering personalized promotions, improved customer support, or tailored service plans. Second, it assists in reducing customer acquisition costs by allocating resources more efficiently and identifying areas for service improvement.

In summary, telecom customer churn prediction is a valuable tool for telecom providers to enhance customer retention efforts, reduce revenue loss, and improve overall customer satisfaction by foreseeing and addressing potential churn before it occurs.



## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using data science and machine learning techniques. Customer churn, the rate at which customers leave a service provider, is a critical concern for telecom companies. This project aims to build a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## Tools and Technologies Used

To develop and execute this project, the following tools and technologies were employed:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter notebooks were used for data exploration, analysis, and documentation.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A Python library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Python libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A machine learning library in Python used for building and evaluating predictive models.

## Dataset Concept

The dataset used for this project contains information about telecom customers, including demographic data, usage patterns, and customer statuses. Key columns in the dataset include:

- `Customer ID`: A unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender`: The gender of the customer.
- `Age`: The age of the customer.
- `Married`: The marital status of the customer.
- `City`: The city of residence.
- `Tenure in Months`: The number of months the customer has been with the telecom service.
- `Churn Category`: The reason for churn, categorized into different classes (e.g., high charges, service-related issues, unknown reasons).

The dataset's concept revolves around using this information to predict which customers are likely to churn and understanding the factors influencing churn. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the implementation of a Random Forest classification model, we aim to achieve this objective.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `images/`: Images used in the project for visualizations.
- `README.md`: The documentation file you are currently reading.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in the specified order to follow the project's progression.
